# Peace Pal

Peace Pal is a game that guides users through a pain and anxiety management exercise.

Play the game at https://keighleymcf.github.io/ironhack-game-project/

Vizualisation can help people who experience pain or anxiety to regain control over their pain.
This game takes users through the steps of visualizing pain as an external object.

The game was developed using p5. It was written using Javascript, HTML, and CSS.
My Trello board contains details of the individual steps of game development: https://trello.com/b/AvRlOTqF/ih-game-project

## Possible future features:

- mobile friendly version
- replace size controls with slider
- "What texture does the ball have" level: shown using sounds or animations when clicking on the ball's surface (e.g. sparks if metallic)

## Bonus: code for unused click-and-drag feature

A feature to move the sphere with a click-and-drag function was developed using p5 but not used for the game in the end. This feature was particularly challenging because in p5, 3D objects are drawn on a different coordinate system than the canvas, so the code needs to translate between the mouse position and the 3D coordinates.
