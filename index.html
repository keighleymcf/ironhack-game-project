          Vizualisation can help people who experience pain or anxiety to regain
          control over their pain.
        </p>
        <p>
          This game takes you through the steps of visualizing pain as an
          external object.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="intro-2">
        <p>
          Imagine the pain or anxiety you are experiencing is a physical object
          outside of you.
        </p>
        <p>
          The game will ask you to describe this object's appearance and feel.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once you have given the object a concrete form, the game will let you
          send away the object.
        </p>
        <p>With it, you will send away your pain or anxiety.</p>
